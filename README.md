### Computer-Organization-2018-spring-NCTU  
The homework/lab of the course lectured by 蔡文錦 in 2018 spring in NCTU  

#Lab content:  
Lab 2: Implement a 32-bit ALU & shifter  
Lab 3: Utilizing the ALU & Shifter in Lab2 to implement a simple single cycle CPU.  
Lab 4: Based on Lab 3 (simple single-cycle CPU), add a memory unit to implement a complete single-cycle CPU which can run R-type,I-type and jump instructions.  
Lab 5: modify the single cycle processor designed in lab4 to a pipelined processor.(without hazard issue)  
Lab 6: modify the CPU designed in Lab5 and implement an advanced version pipelined CPU which can handle hazard.  
  
Respective detailed specification will be enclosed in PDFs.
